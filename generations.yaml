    description: "The Peugeot 207 was introduced as the successor to the highly successful 206, growing significantly in size and moving upmarket with improved quality and safety features. Based on PSA's Platform 1 (shared with Citroën C3), it featured more aggressive styling with an enlarged grille, distinctive headlights, and a more substantial overall appearance. Available in a wide range of body styles including three and five-door hatchbacks, the 207 CC with a folding metal roof (launched December 2006), and the 207 SW station wagon, with a sedan variant (207 Passion) offered in some markets. Powertrain options included various gasoline engines from 1.4L to 1.6L, including new turbocharged units co-developed with BMW (EP6 engines such as the 1.6 THP producing 175 hp in the GTi/RC), and diesel options from 1.4L to 1.6L HDi, paired with manual or automatic transmissions. The interior featured improved materials and a more modern design compared to the 206, with available features including a panoramic glass roof, dual-zone climate control, and upgraded audio systems. Safety was significantly enhanced with a stronger structure and increased standard safety equipment, earning a 5-star Euro NCAP rating. Production began in April 2006 at plants in Poissy (France), Madrid (Spain), and Trnava (Slovakia). The 207 was replaced by the Peugeot 208 in April 2012."

  - name: "First Generation (Facelift)"
    start_year: 2009
    end_year: 2014
    description: "The Peugeot 207 received a significant facelift in July 2009, featuring a slightly smaller grille and revised front lighting with new fog lamp housings, along with LED lights on the rear. Some engine management software changes were also made, boosting the power of the GTi from 150 to 175 hp. The refreshed model continued alongside the newly launched 208 until April 2012, when the 208 became the primary successor. However, production of the facelifted 207 continued in certain markets until 2014 to meet ongoing demand. The facelift maintained the same platform and mechanical lineup but offered updated styling both inside and out, with revised dashboard materials and enhanced equipment levels. Despite mixed reviews regarding interior quality and gearbox refinement, the 207 achieved strong sales, ranking as the sixth best-selling car in Britain in 2007 with over 67,000 units sold that year."
